E-CommerceWeb-Application

I developed a mini E-Commerce web application as a self project apart from academics during my undergrad.

I have provided the following functionalities:
1. User can Login or Signup.
2. If users forget password, a reset password link will be sent.
3. Users can select product by category and add it to the cart.
4. They can update the quantity of any product or delete the product in the cart.
5. Users can checkout and track the order under orders tab.
6. Users can cancel order before it is delivered.
7. The account settings can be modified by the user.

I have used PHP, HTML and CSS to develop UI and implement logic.
I used MySQL for database and XAMPP to host the web application on local host.
